 <p> I was born on the 21st of Janurary 2002. I am currently in year 10 and I am intersted in Information and Software Technology and Engineering.</p>
 <p> I like IST as it interests me as I learn how computer function but it also allows me to inderstand how a computer works but also that you can create something from nothing. I also like Engineering as it challenges the way that I think</p>
